You can write here descriptions of tone or even B-roll. These descriptions will not be exported in the script but help setting up the video.

> Then you can write as a quote the text you intend to utter.  
> To facilitate subsequent reading of the script, it is helpful to write short sentences.
> It also helps to separate sentences and write each on a distinct row.
